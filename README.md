# deno-astro-integration

This is an experimental project to create an [Astro](https://astro.build/) integration using [Deno](https://deno.com/). It includes two directories: `jsr` and `npm`. The `jsr` directory contains an Astro integration developed with Deno, which has been published on [JSR](https://jsr.io/). On the other hand, the `npm` directory contains the identical Astro integration but is set up for publication on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) via [dnt](https://github.com/denoland/dnt).

Here are the links to the published integrations:
